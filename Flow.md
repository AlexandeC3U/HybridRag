# Hybrid RAG System - Comprehensive Flow Documentation

## System Overview

The Hybrid RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system combines vector similarity search with knowledge graph relationships to provide context-aware AI responses. The system uses multiple databases (Qdrant for vectors, Neo4j for graphs) and integrates local LLM support via OLLAMA.
