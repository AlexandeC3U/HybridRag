**TODOs and buglist**

Critical Issues & Bugs
1. Configuration Inconsistencies
Bug: In config.py, there's a mismatch between attribute names used in the code and the actual settings class attributes
Issue: Code references MAX_CONTEXT_LENGTH, SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD, ENABLE_RERANKING but these don't exist in the Settings class
Fix: The settings class uses max_context_length, similarity_threshold but the code uses uppercase versions
2. Missing Error Handling in Graph Search
Bug: In graph_search.py line 305, the get_entity_relationships method uses APOC procedures without checking if they're available
Issue: The APOC plugin might not be installed, causing runtime errors
Fix: Add proper error handling and fallback logic
3. Docker Configuration Issues
Bug: Dockerfile references non-existent directories (config/ directory doesn't exist)
Issue: The Docker build will fail because it tries to copy config/ directory
Fix: Remove the COPY config/ ./config/ line since config is in src/
4. Missing Dependencies
Bug: requirements.txt includes pydantic==2.5.0 but the code uses pydantic_settings which isn't listed
Issue: The application will fail to start due to missing pydantic-settings dependency
5. Async/Sync Mismatch
Bug: In vector_search.py, the _create_collection method is async but calls synchronous Qdrant client methods
Issue: This can cause blocking behavior in the async event loop


Performance & Optimization Issues
1. Inefficient Embedding Generation
Issue: In data_ingestion.py, embeddings are generated for each chunk individually instead of batching
Optimization: Batch embedding generation for better performance
2. Memory Leaks in ThreadPoolExecutor
Issue: Multiple components create ThreadPoolExecutors but don't properly manage their lifecycle
Fix: Ensure proper cleanup in all components
3. Redundant NLP Model Loading
Issue: Both graph_search.py and query_router.py load spaCy models independently
Optimization: Create a shared NLP service to avoid duplicate model loading
4. Inefficient Graph Queries
Issue: In graph_search.py, the search method performs multiple separate queries instead of using a single optimized query
Optimization: Combine queries using UNION or OPTIONAL MATCH


Security Issues
1. Hardcoded Credentials
Issue: Default passwords in config.py and docker-compose.yml
Fix: Use environment variables for all sensitive data
2. CORS Configuration
Issue: CORS is set to allow all origins ("*") which is insecure for production
Fix: Restrict to specific domains
3. Missing Input Validation
Issue: Limited validation on user inputs in API endpoints
Fix: Add comprehensive input validation and sanitization


Architecture Issues
1. Tight Coupling
Issue: Components are tightly coupled, making testing and maintenance difficult
Fix: Implement dependency injection and interfaces
2. Missing Health Checks
Issue: Health check endpoint doesn't verify database connectivity
Fix: Add comprehensive health checks for all dependencies
3. No Rate Limiting
Issue: No protection against API abuse
Fix: Implement rate limiting middleware


Code Quality Issues
1. Inconsistent Error Handling
Issue: Some methods return empty lists on error, others raise exceptions
Fix: Standardize error handling across all components
2. Missing Type Hints
Issue: Some methods lack proper type hints
Fix: Add comprehensive type annotations
3. Hardcoded Values
Issue: Magic numbers and strings scattered throughout the code
Fix: Move to configuration constants


Missing Features
1. No Monitoring/Logging
Issue: Limited observability into system performance
Fix: Add structured logging and metrics collection
2. No Caching
Issue: No caching mechanism for frequently accessed data
Fix: Implement Redis or in-memory caching
3. No Backup Strategy
Issue: No data backup or recovery mechanisms
Fix: Implement backup procedures for both databases



Recommended Fixes (Priority Order)
- Fix configuration inconsistencies - Update attribute names to match
